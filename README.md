This project helps in creating artistic images using neural style transfer
Neural Style Transfer

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for performing neural style transfer. Neural style transfer is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another to generate visually appealing results.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:


2. Install Dependencies:
   torch, PIL ..

3. Upload Content and Style Images:

Place your content and style images in the `images` directory within the repository.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the `Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.


5. Update Parameters:

In the notebook, update parameters like `content_img_path`, `style_img_path`, `size`, `steps`, `c_weight`, and `s_weight` according to your preferences.

6. Run the Notebook:

Execute the cells in the notebook one by one. This will perform the neural style transfer and display the output image.

## Additional Notes

- Experiment with different content and style images for diverse stylization effects.
- Adjust hyperparameters and optimization settings for better results.
- Consider using a GPU for faster processing, especially for high-resolution images.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter issues.

Happy stylizing!
